# FinalProject

# For this final project I have done an analysis of the bee population in the USA that I found on Kaggle. 

Originally I got a data set from 1998 - 2012 but was able to tetrieve a version that included the years 1990 until 2017.
The data set includes information on the number of colonies per state, yield per colony, total yield per state and the price at which it is sold per lb. 
This data is organised per state per year. 

For the ananlysis I have certain goal I would like to achieve. 

- I want to analyse the increase or decrease in bee populations/total production/efficiency of the bees and determine what canbe concluded from this. 
- Second I want to do an prediction on the future of honey production and prices in the USA through linear regression. 

- As a second step in the analysis proces I will be comparing the data set to a data set on pesticides, pollution and climate te determine what the main factors are that are influcencing the change in this essential industry. 

- Finally I would like to give a recommendation to future beekeepers to afvice them where they should locate themselves based on their aspirations.

For the analysis I will be looking both on regional and state level. Below there is an image with the map of how the states are devided into regions North, South, West and Midwest.

To start off, here is an image with development of honey production from 1990 until 2017

We can see that the average number of colonies is quite steady over the year but that in the graph that displays the average yield per colony the yield is slowly decreasing. As a result of this decrease in production the price per lb is rising which occurs when products become more scarse. What suprised me of this graph is how little decrease there is in bee polulations as this is something that is in the news quite frequently. 

** (add % decrease per region)

In this image we can see a similar graph but this one displays the decrease in avarage production and the increased price per lb while the increased production value is displayed below.

In the following image we can see the efficiency, price of honey per lb and the total production value of the state. If you were a honey producer during these years and care most about total production value you should have located yourself in North Dakota if you cared most about efficiency to reduce workload you should have located yourself in Louisiana and if you care most about the price of your product because you want to be an high quality producer you should locate yourself in Verginia. 



Following this analysis I did a comparision between this data set and the two data sets that I had mentioned before.

First we will be looking at the use of pesticides in the USA


![States stop using pesticide due to new laws (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104360125/187408234-5a6db1ac-9827-466d-ad8c-9e673b8dc443.png) Use of NEONIC pesticides in the USA. 


When plotting the use of NEONIC pesticides in tableau we can see that the use of these pesticides really took off between 2002 - 2004. The only state that was using it before these years was California. Looking at 2015 we can see that almost all states but again besides California stopped the use of these pesticides. I did some quick reseach and found out that this was due to a new bill that would ban the use of these pestices, the use of them increased again after this date since the bill never passed.
